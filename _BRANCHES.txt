_BRANCHES

cd D:\__MEMECOIN_SCANNER\_memecoin_scanner


Create a new branch called dev and switch to it:
git checkout -b dev

switch to the main branch:
git checkout main

Check which branch you're using:
git branch -a


Set tracking:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

Work in the dev branch (edit your files and commit changes):
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented new feature in dev branch"
git push origin dev


Merge dev into main when ready:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge dev
git push origin main
